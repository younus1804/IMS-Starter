Coverage: 68.1%
# Project Title

Project Description: To create a fully functioning inventory management system which enables the user to manage customers, items and orders. The application will be tested and must have a coverage of at least 80%.

## Getting Started

1) Clone repo on local machine
2) "java -jar ims-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar" Running this command in cmd will enable you to use the IMS.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

JAVA 1.8 - Able to download online
MYSQL - Able to download online
Eclipse
Give examples
Example: In order to run this application you need Java installed locally.
Eclipse also needed to open java files and edit.


## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system. Break down into which tests and what they do

On eclipse if we right click IMS-Starter after importing it into eclipse, we can then run it as a JUnit file which will tell us exactly how much coverage we have and where we have failed tests.
Alternatively we can test individual files by right clicking them and running them as JUnit.

### Unit Tests 

Explain what these tests test, why and how to run them
Unit tests test the foundation of an application. The idea is to prove that each unit of the programme is working
```
Give an example
Running a unit test for ItemTest.java will test all getters, setters and constructors in the file.
